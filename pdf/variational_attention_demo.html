i do n&#39;t know where to start judging by the name of the restaurant i thought this would be your ordinary family eatery i was wrong the first thing i see as i walk in is young lady twerking by the entrance bar i thought it was due to the chicken being really good but i was wrong again the music was so loud that you are better off asking the waitress to step outside to order your food i ordered over the phone on the third try i was finally able to hear the person that answered the chicken was dry and hard careful if you have dentures the only thing that was decent was the rice and beans and the mac and cheese my wife spent the entire night <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">vomiting</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">ect</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">most</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">likely</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">poisoning</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">would</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">n&#39;t</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">recommend</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">this</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">place</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> anyone i like or dislike

the <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">restaurant</span> &#39;s decor is pretty and the menu contains nice options but i will have to second the other reviewer on the <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> being too salty and the tea being too sweet i ordered the prix fix lunch menu for $ 0 or $ 0 i chose the salad of the day arugula with goat cheese and beets the chicken thighs in mushroom cream sauce and the dessert of the day mango custard i also ordered the royal fruit tea the whole meal arrived slowly considering it was not crowded the tea did n&#39;t arrive until after the first course the tea was too sweet for me when i asked if it had sugar in it the waitress hostess not sure her <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">exact</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">role</span> told me that it was sweetened with fruit juice which at that point was neither here nor there the arugula salad was by far the best part of my meal and after long wait my chicken thighs in mushroom creme sauce arrived they forgot to bring my side of brown rice but the chicken thighs were served with some kind if root vegetable mash and julienned vegetables so rice would have been a little excessive for me anyway the chicken thighs were moist with crunchy skin but the mushroom sauce was very salty after another long wait <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> brought the mango custard which was more of a sorbet it was served with some sort of sugary crunchy granola like granules and a bit of raspberry sauce for garnish at this point i was already beginning to not feel so well the staff was very friendly but that does n&#39;t account for the fact that i <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">got</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">either</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">an</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">excess</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">of</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">salt</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">or</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">use</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">of</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">additive</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">such</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">as</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">msg</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i&#39;m</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">really</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sorry</span> to <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">have</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">share</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">that</span> information but a proper tea house in great neck was something i was very much looking forward to and i was disappointed

we have been coming here since the place opened and we got our friends hooked on their goodies as well the ingredients are fresh but the newer employees need to be in serviced by the owner to wear gloves when handling food that will not be cooked i e fruits i <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">understand</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">that</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">there</span> is a big turn around with the employees in the front because students usually work there but the owner should care if someone gives bad service the employees in the kitchen and the gentleman that does the crepes i am bad with names are very friendly and respecting of the owner &#39;s business they all know us and they are friendly towards anyone who comes in unfortunately for the owner turn around with the employees at the register can cause some loyal costumers to stop coming when i respectfully asked the girl who place fruit with the bear hands on my yogurt to take the fruit off the frozen yogurt the other girl who was at the register register tried to argue with me and tell me that the fruit was in the peal when the other employee was touching it i know what i see and i have been coming to this establishment for years and i certainty can tell when a fruit is in a peal or not i did not tell her that but i explained that she does not need to make a new yogurt and simply remove the fruit that was touched and replace it she did do it after several times of me asking her that she shoved it towards me with an attitude after <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> watch <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">what</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> eat and i rarely splurge on extra calories and i simply wanted a small treat after a long day at <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">work</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">what</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">got</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">an</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">attitude</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">confrontation</span> about something that should never have happened <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">am</span> a loyal costumer and i did not come off the street to pick a fight with someone and write a bad review over some nonsense <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">poisoning</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">is</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">various</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">serious</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">thing</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">that</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">can</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">be</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">caused</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">by</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">bacteria</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">transmitted</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">by</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">bare</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hands</span> amongst <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">other</span> things wear gloves !

the good parking was easy and free the outdoor seating area by the waterside had nice views for appetizers our party of 0 split two of the hot antipasto for 0 and everything except the calamari was very good the calamari was just okay but the appetizer portions were enough for three people each the lobster ravioli i ordered was delicious and in a good portion not too big and not too small the bad when we called ahead to make a reservation we were n&#39;t told there would be a wedding occupying the entire indoors section i enjoyed the views of the outdoors section but for long stretches of time during our meal there were n&#39;t any waiters available because they were busy serving the many guests of the wedding also to get a sense of the pricing i paid around $ 0 including the 0 % mandatory gratuity to pay for 0 of an appetizer platter 0 of a pitcher of sangria and a pasta dish i &#39;d be okay with that if the service was exceptional but it was n&#39;t the unacceptable as poster a c mentions below 0 of the 0 members of our group wanted to pay using credit cards the waiter actually said if you all were n&#39;t willing to pay the bill on one credit card then you should not have come here to eat with each other as a group and as a c mentioned the waiter literally refused to accept our visa and american express credit cards the waiter said he would only accept one credit card or everyone has to pay cash one of us wanted to call the waiter &#39;s bluff and threaten to leave without paying if he did n&#39;t accept our credit cards but ultimately someone agreed to put the entire $ 0 bill on his credit card to appease the waiter who spent most of the meal ignoring us last but not least it &#39;s never a good sign when someone gets food <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">poisoning</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">symptoms</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">within</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">few</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hours</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">after</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">eating</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">lunch</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">at</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">restaurant</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">joked</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">that</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">c</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">has</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">traveled</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">third</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">world</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">countries</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">before</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">without</span> getting <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">but</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">one</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">meal</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">at</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">this</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">place</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">led</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">her</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">spending</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">rest</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">of</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">her</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">saturday</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">in</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">her</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">bathroom</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">summary</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">0</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">stars</span> good parking good ravioli good portions solid appetizer platter inattentive service due to being busy during a wedding we were n&#39;t warned about when we called ahead and an outright belligerent waiter who was unilaterally setting strict limitations on terms of payment with no leverage whatsoever i seriously wish we had just threatened to leave if he refused our credit cards but instead we paid our bill and graciously vowed to never come back this way that waiter does n&#39;t have to worry about being asked to handle our credit cards in the future

as someone who likes craft beer and microbreweries this place caught my eye when i was looking for a place to eat prior to a show i actually ended up visiting twice because i had a very pleasant first experience the atmosphere was cool the beers were good and the food to me was slightly above average for typical bar food in fact i liked my food enough that i ordered the same entree both times i visited the pulled pork sandwich that being said the pulled pork did not sit well after my second visit and i ended up <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">vomiting</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">within</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">0</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hours</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">of</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">my</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">visit</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">always</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hesitate</span> to say that kind of thing in a review because i would never want to falsely insinuate that a restaurant made me <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> but <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">all</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">signs</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">indicated</span> that it was likely <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">related</span> and not a bout of gastroenteritis needless to say if i returned i would probably stick to the beers alone

tofu for spice level the options are as follows mild medium spicy and x spicy i went with the goldilocks of not quite needing a fire extinguisher for my mouth but leaving my colon intact aka spicy i hit submit for my order ohhhhhhhh we &#39;re halfway there ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh but we &#39;re actually all the way there because the delivery was so fucking fast it was basically like i hit submit on my

tall and narrow containers like for soup interesting had to go fishing for different components of this stuff because i found that due to the differing density and buoyancy of course i forget how all of that shit works sigh of the various items eggplant peppers tofu rice etc they tended to distribute themselves at different depths of this curry sea i&#39;m not particularly fond of fishing initially i was really gung ho about these flavors of my curry sea i might even have let out an mmmm or two probably not i was alone alone with john oliver that would be weird there were these little

i&#39;m usually not too impressed by japanese curry but throw in my choice of spice level and suddenly it does n&#39;t seem that bland anymore at least that was my experience at abiko which is going to be my go to place for japanese curry from now i <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">got</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">my</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">curry</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">at</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">level</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">0</span> spice the thick slab of tonkatsu was pretty good by itself but after adding in the sweat inducing curry i could n&#39;t stop eating it ok i took a couple of breaks to cool down my mouth and my body was not happy with me the next morning but it tasted great i usually find that the taste of red pepper overwhelms the curry flavor as opposed to say thai chili or green chili which can be just as hot but does n&#39;t interfere as much with the other flavors but as spicy the food was i could still taste everything else so that &#39;s a major plus i think the next level of spice would probably do that though service was excellent i have to add my friend who had spent an hour in their restroom had to be stretchered away to the er not from their <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> she was <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">before</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">but</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">not</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">even</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">single</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">peep</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">them</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">will</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">definitely</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">be</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">back</span>

went here for a meal on friday february 0 th 0 ordered a salad the swiss fondue as well as 0 gin martini after two sips of the martini i realized i had been drugged i asked my server what is in this martini ? and he simply said it &#39;s straight gin i replied yes i&#39;m aware of the taste of gin which is why i enjoy a nice cold gin martini and my tolerance allows me to have two or three martinis depending on the size without getting inebriated so please tell me what else is in this martini ? he had no response to my inquiry so obviously i stopped with sipping the martini shortly after that my <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> brought to my table thank god i <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg

digging in i had it folded and ready in my pocket for whenever the bill was to come when the waiter came back to refill my water i asked for the bill even though i was no where near half way done with my meal as i was feeling the effects of whatever drug i took two sips of from that martini continued eating as fast as i could as i did n&#39;t want to waste the delicious food and then the bill came several minutes later i <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">paid</span> before he <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">even</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> chance to get change even left a tip and then i immediately fled the restaurant mind you this was in february so when i impatiently walked outside into the street i noticed the temperature change was drastic it was incredibly freezing outside ! however i was also grateful for the extreme cold at this time as without it i would n&#39;t have felt very awake in my surroundings so thank god for the cold and thank god i caught an uber driver in less than 0 minutes standing outside by myself trying to hail a taxi additionally i&#39;m blessed my

very sad to know that such a nice restaurant such as this one is capable of drugging a human being and it teaches me to always always watch any cocktail i order to be made in front of my own two eyes as of today i am seeing on yelp that this restaurant is now closed and i&#39;m happy it is no longer in business that my friends is called karma to all people who travel alone and occasionally get a cocktail or two with their meal please watch your drinks being made always better to be safe than sorry take care

in a rude manner i clarified by explaining to her yes the customer explained to the employee at a poke establishment that there are in fact several different types of tuna there is no regular type of tuna what i consider to be the regular type of tuna might be different from another person &#39;s upon my clarification she asked her colleague who was working the cashier who came over she too was puzzled and said it was the regular type again this means nothing to me erring on the safe side i opted for two servings of the salmon from my experience eating poke and sashimi i am of hawaiian descent the regular tuna looked like yellowfin tuna however i was still skeptical it is common for fish suppliers to inject co into their fish to maintain a certain color that resembles a fish like yellowfish tuna i am furious for a restaurant that prides itself on its fresh fish saying freshness is the most important thing for pokee see gabriel m &#39;s 0 review he was the reviewer hospitalized with food <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">poisoning</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">after</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">eating</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">here</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">this</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">lack</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">of</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">general</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">understanding</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">of</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">fish</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">is</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">simply</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">unacceptable</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">preparers</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">should</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">have</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">known</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">exactly</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">what</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">type</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">of</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">fish</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">being</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">served</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">not</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">only</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">is</span> this a health concern for individuals like myself who are more sensitive to certain types of fish than others but it also speaks volumes about the lack of concern pokee places on customer satisfaction and the lack of time pokee dedicates to employee training i am hoping to speak to ms wang or another co owner over the phone to discuss my situation i expect that this matter will be investigated promptly and thoroughly and i look forward to hearing from ms wang or another co owner about the changes stemming from such investigation additionally it goes without saying that after this incident some type of reimbursement or compensation is needed

when the bill came we were a bit shocked $ 0 for 0 people makes sense given the amount of food we ordered but it was n&#39;t mind blowing across the board if i came again i would only do a la carte tuna just some of salmon sea bass and eel and skip the rest it was a bit disappointing that they do n&#39;t really tell you what you &#39;re going to get and when the food stops so you end up having this crazy bill but we really enjoyed our time there when i went home i was actually prepared to write a 0 star review after a little bit i started getting <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">stomach</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">pains</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">after</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">all</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">attempted</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">be</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">digested</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">spent</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">next</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">0</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hours</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">dealing</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">with</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">diarrhea</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">stomain</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">pains</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">woke</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">up</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">again</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">at</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">0</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">am</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">dealt</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">with</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">it</span> again <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> &#39;ve <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">omakase</span> at several places in the bay area and tokyo and never had issues so was surprised to experience food <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">poisoning</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">at</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">so</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">called</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">best</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">omakase</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">place</span> in nyc <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">after</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">that</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">unfortunate</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">ending</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> do n&#39;t plan to eat seafood especially sashimi for a little while

service is nice and food is definitely at reasonable price and good amount of sittings for eating in but take out is available too the quality and food of the taste however is another story so let start with the taste first the taste of the food itself was n&#39;t bad in fact it was decent but due to how greasy they make their food and the quality of it just make you want to stop eating after awhile like half way down your food or for my case was close to the end of my meal i feel kind of <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg

class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">with</span> sausage and <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">home</span> fries with 0 rye toasts egg was good home fries was good but not closer to me finishing it up ketchup is meh sausage is so oily and the quality scared me a little over all was alright except the rye toasts i know rye toasts are normally harder than white toasts and such but the ones i got was almost aa hard as a rock first piece was harder than i except it and i would usually like it to be but it could pass but the second piece i actually had a hard time biting into it and one of the bites i even almost hurt myself it almost scraped the top of my mouth difficult to eat when it is that hard as for the quality of the food ketchup is like fake ketchup and it &#39;s so sour and watery potatoes are a bit smooshy and soggy and the texture indicates that their are n&#39;t that fresh and how it was grown it is not the skill of the chief i promise i do n&#39;t personally know the chief but i believe that the chief <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">know</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">what</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">he</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">she</span> is doing it is clearly the problem of their ingredients and where it came from same thing with their onions so what scares me about the sausages was that 0 i am not the type of the person that expect much although i know my <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg

ansi-bold">picky</span> this time i was expecting to see two sausages that 0 separated as in two sausages and 0 a but rounder as in the diameter but what i got when i opened it was two somewhat flat sausages that i thought was like grilled chicken or pork chops no really i am serious i thought they gave me the <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">wrong</span> order or that i clicked on the wrong choice also the sausages are more like chewier hot dogs than actually sausages and their are somewhat transparent fat lumps and small pieces of marrow bones things in the sausages are not what i had except or usually have maybe is it because i grew up <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">having</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">european</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> asian meat especially good quality german hams and sausages that this really freaked me out i would never recommend anyone to go here and i myself would n&#39;t go again either but they are nice and good for something fast if you are really on a budget although i know some other places with similar pricing and much better quality in flushing so i would n&#39;t bother to put this on my list but i mean it does open early so i guess you can say that &#39;s a bonus for people who need food that wake up early ?

probably a little late on the review considering the restaurant is now closed for good i always loved this place so was sad when i walked by and noticed they were closing i convinced my boyfriend to go one last time 0 days before it was gone well in hindsight going to a restaurant that is closing to eat is probably not the best idea as i am sure they had checked out already and likely the food was n&#39;t as fresh as it could have been using up <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">what</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">left</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">etc</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">that</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">eve</span> it was n&#39;t spectacular but not terrible just average we ordered drinks but when we got the check it was wrong overcharged by 0 drinks then flash forward about 0 hours and i was completely ill so <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">cancel</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">work</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">for</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">days</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">be</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">something</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">tainted</span> or mishandled horrible painful completely awful moral of this story do not eat in a restaurant that is about to close its doors for good no matter how great it has been in the past the final days are likely going to be a massive disappointment

a bit on the cheap side since it is pricey there we also ordered japchae seafood pancake and bu dae jjigae the seafood pancake was the reason for the one star or else it would of gotten zero star the seafood was filled with seafood and very crispy crispy did the trick ! the japchae on the other hand was just okay i had better japchae at other korean restaurants and the japchae here could n&#39;t compare to them also we ordered the japchae with seafood but they served japchae with beef we did n&#39;t complain since we also ordered a pot of seafood the bu dae jjigae was good it was a bit on the spicy side but tolerable the ingredients were interesting especially hot dog and pepperoni but it was pretty good after eating seafood pancake japchae and bu dae jjigae the worst experience that i <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">have</span> ever <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">in</span> a <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">restaurant</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">followed</span> they brought our last dish steamed seafood pot to our table it looked great it smelled good it was filled to the top with crabs mussels clans and conchi we were excited to eat it we took one bite into the crabs and spit it out immediately the crabs were not fresh at all the meat was powdery needless to say we did n&#39;t take another bite of the crabs and just put them on our plate to throw out then we tried the mussels which had an amazing surprise inside once we opened some of the mussels up the inside of the mussels looked black and smelled horrible yes what an amazing surprise right ? the mussels that looked decent enough to eat we ate them but they still had a <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">bad</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">taste</span> to them we were not happy with this and decided to speak up we talked to the manager and he apologized and took the pot of seafood away the best part of the experience was watching the chefs in the kitchen taking pieces of the seafood out of the returned pot of seafood and smelling them themselves then tossing them out they acted like they knew this pot of seafood was not good and thought they can just pass it off to the customers without any complaints when it was time to get the bill they only took off the steamed pot of seafood we still got <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">charged</span> for <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">crabs</span> obviously we complained once more they took off the crabs as well in a situation like this in any other restaurants they would provide a free dish in place of their mistake and give a discount for their mistake but this was not the case here the manager refused to give us a discount we informed them that seafood is something they ca n&#39;t play around with since it is a leading cause to food <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">poisoning</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">they</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">brushed</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">us</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">off</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">saying</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">if</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">you</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">get</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">bring</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">medical</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">bill</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">us</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">we</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">will</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">pay</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">for</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">it</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">so</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">if</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">got</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">poisoned</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">their</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">have</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">take</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">days</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">off</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">work</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">go</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">doctor</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">then</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">their</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">restaurant</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">get</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">compensated</span> ?

i&#39;m writing this review because i unfortunately had an awful experience i came here for my birthday mid week and there were only two waitresses working and it was like 0 pm i came with a group of 0 people we all ordered food and calling over a waitress to even ask for water took forever i had an 0 pm bus to catch and we met here with enough time to eat and me to make the bus on time little did i know that i would miss that bus the waitress took her time giving us the bill and when my friend had approached her and told her that we needed the bill cards ran through she seemed to take even longer even getting the bill was a hassle since the waitresses were either busy or distracted i did not make my bus at all even when we gave the waitress a sense of urgency i woke up the next morning <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">incredibly</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">my</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">stomach</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sweating</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">incredibly</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">weak</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">&#39;d</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">thrown</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">up</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">since</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">0</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">am</span> and missed work i called tortaria and the woman i spoke to was incredibly rude i told her i had food <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">poisoning</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">she</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">asked</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">if</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">gone</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">doctor</span> and been officially diagnosed otherwise she said i could be making it all <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">up</span> she then proceeded to ask what i wanted them to do for me my complaints of getting <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">slow</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">service</span> and missing my bus did n&#39;t seem to matter to her at all i wound up speaking to someone at the head of the franchise that owns this place and i still didnt feel as though i was given a geniune apology or any way to have this experience made up i was incredibly disappointed that somewhere with such good reviews had such terrible and unattentive service and accused me of making up my being <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> in order to get something from the restaraunt

i have never written a negative review but i feel compelled to warn people against visiting gallo nero the food was middle school cafeteria quality at best i ordered a red snapper that was flaccid skinless and waterlogged amidst a sea of butter and over undercooked asparagus the sun dried tomatoes it was topped with were in fact a sparse handful of tasteless regular tomatoes the fish which was unrecognizable as a snapper had a dubious fishy taste i felt distinctly unwell for the remainder of the evening my friend had the salmon which was tasteless and dry despite that it was also swimming in a buttery sauce to use a generous word and she also left feeling sick to her <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">stomach</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">all</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">in</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">all</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">this</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">worst</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">have</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">ever</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">at</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">restaurant</span> in new york we were genuinely lamenting that we had not grabbed slices of dollar pizza instead the service was reasonable which is the only reason i left more than one star

i have absolutely no reason or desire to ever order from this place again i placed an order through seamless and when i received the delivery the first thing wrong was that they had given me a tamarind drink instead of orchata i called them to tell them about the mixup and they told me to call the next day because they were closing for the night i asked as politely as possible if there was any way i could receive the orchata tonight because i had been craving one not only did they say no which if left at that would &#39;ve been perfectly acceptable but the person on the phone started laughing and continued to talk to someone else while ignoring me completely the next thing that went wrong was when i <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">ate</span> <span

<span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">meat</span> it was grossly undercooked and maybe i had bit into a piece of cartilage or something so i tossed that one aside and went on to the other food everything tasted somewhat off however i had just gotten to relax after an incredibly stressful <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">day</span> to the end of a long stressful week which is why i decided to treat myself to seamless instead of going to get groceries to cook myself some food i was so ravenous to the point of actually shaking that despite only flavors in the meal being gratuitous spice blandness and something a little funky i could n&#39;t quite place my finger on i scarfed down the food that seemed to be cooked well enough in less than 0 mins after i finished my

for the past few years they have consistently had a b rating by the health department i always decided to overlook that in light of the good experiences i &#39;ve had there in the past once when meeting friends there i <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">actually</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">stood</span> outside directly in front of the health grade so that my friends would not see the b upon arrival we all survived that <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">night</span> but just last week wednesday jan 0 i went to yuka and had arguably the worst meal i &#39;ve ever had at a sushi place i ordered the <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">all</span> you can eat as i always do first round came and among the other pieces of shriveled up anemic pieces of <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">fish</span> on the tray was a piece of tuna that looked like it had been thawed frozen thawed again left in the sun for 0 <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hours</span> frozen again thawed thrown on the sidewalk for the afternoon rinsed off and then delivered to my table why did i even attempt to eat this thing ? i ended <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">up</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">gagging</span> on it and spitting it into my napkin i decided to just push that aside and try another piece every other piece on the tray a small order was edible but tasted like it was a little off not horrendous like the tuna but certainly anything but fresh giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt partially because it had been so good to me for so many years and also because the servers are all super nice people no complaints about the service at all ever i decided to order a second round and keep working at the all you can eat thing maybe things would improve i ordered an entirely different selection of fish for the second round no tuna but plenty of fish mackerel yellowtail salmon that <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">been</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">doused</span> in lemon juice which i can only assume is a common trick to cover up the taste of rancid fish as well as some which just had an overall slimy and mushy consistency with an ever so subtle hint of garbage rotting in the sun in the middle of august the salmon was pretty good yay for the salmon ! and yet why would anyone in their right mind actually order a third round ? none would but this is me so i kept pressing on this time i decided to only order cooked fish so it was octopus squid eel &amp; cucumber roll and a salmon skin roll the octopus and squid were fine the salmon skin <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">roll</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">smelled</span> and tasted like a science experiment and the eel and cucumber roll was slimy and had such a weird and worrisome taste that i simply could n&#39;t go on that was it i left with several pieces <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">left</span> on my tray and a few masticated pieces swaddled in napkins and smashed into a ball at the edge of the table i was prepared to complain about the quality if they decided to charge me a la carte for the uneaten pieces but they did n&#39;t so i left quietly and waited to see if i actually <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">got</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">aside</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">some</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">mild</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">nausea</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">alright</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">did</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">n&#39;t</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">have</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">much</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">of</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">an</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">appetite</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">for</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">next</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">0</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hours</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">doubt</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">&#39;ll</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">be</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">eating</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sushi</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">again</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">soon</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">will</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">go</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">back</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">yuka</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">?</span> highly unlikely unless they get that health department grade up to an a for starters maybe i just went on the one bad <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">night</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">they</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">&#39;ve</span> ever <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">had</span> ?

does language like you have to leave you ca n&#39;t stay to a guest sound the same as i&#39;m sorry i forgot to tell you that our dine in was closed at 0 ? and yes common sense tells ppl that the restaurant is still open if the door is open &amp; other guests are still sitting inside even though i misjudged the time does it cost the woman a million to explain in a polite fashion ? i&#39;m not afraid that you post the email in here in fact you probably overestimate the clientele who need to read a long review on a diner not per se eleven madison park i did work in restaurants but it &#39;s the first time to see an owner manager treat a matter like you maybe you guys employ a fancy training system more superior to any other nyc restaurant maybe you just do n&#39;t care the service quality since you &#39;ll lump in $$$ despite the fact the guests who have <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">diarrhea</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">after</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">eating</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">your</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">at</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">chinatown</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">store</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">or</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">some</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">staff</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">utilized</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">impolite</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">language</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">her</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">preference</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">btw</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">you</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">can</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">post</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">email</span> in facebook and google review too you &#39;re very welcome

i live in the area and ended up here on both friday and saturday nights there have been a couple improvements and one big misstep since my last visit which was 0 stars first the good i had tuna tar tar the cauliflower and the brussels sprouts and all 0 were very good the cauliflower center was a bit under but in all the food was much better also private party here was awesome i would highly recommend this place for private parties unfortunately 0 stars is still probably nice of me we had friday oysters and the west coast oysters were really fishy my friend got <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">after</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">reading</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">others</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">complain</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">about</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">oysters</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">this</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">is</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">serious</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">issue</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">actually</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">major</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">reason</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">why</span> i&#39;m upgrading to 0 stars despite this major issue is because of the late night dj and bar experience this place has great music and a fun scene late night now so i do n&#39;t necessarily expect good party scene places to have the best food and lets be honest murray hill we do n&#39;t deserve anything other than late night bar scenes with djs

this review relates to my experience with abace via seamless delivery is consistently 0 minutes longer than their stated estimate i have spoken to seamless multiple times regarding the restaurant misstating their wait time it &#39;s not fair to other restaurants who are honest and i was told they would speak to the restaurant but as far as i can tell the delivery times have never been corrected the only reason i have complained multiple times instead of just not ordering from abace is there is no way to remove a restaurant from your seamless list or otherwise mark it as do not order and as far as i can tell seamless has n&#39;t updated customer reviews for more than 0 years based on sorting reviews by most recent my one star review has never been published as a result every 0 months i forget and accidentally order from abace again based on their stellar seamless rating and reasonable delivery time after last week however i do n&#39;t think i &#39;ll be forgetting again per usual food arrived 0 minutes later than the high end of their stated delivery window the sushi tasted a little funky so i did not finish it and i got food <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">poisoning</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">bad</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">fish</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">!</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">between</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">vomiting</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">extreme</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">body</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">aches</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">fever</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">silver</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">lining</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">is</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">will</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">now</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">remember</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">never</span> to order <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> abace again perhaps abace has better service in person but i wo n&#39;t be finding out

yeah what do you picture ? darkness darkness ? yeah darkness what do you mean ? like death is just darkness when i think about what death looks like i just picture darkness do you believe in ghosts ? yeah of course i mean not like conventional ghosts but i believe that there is some form of consciousness that is beyond human comprehension so different from our own that it &#39;s inconceivable so like there are ghosts we just have no idea what ghosts actually are so like ghosts knocking books off shelves at <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">night</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">communicating</span> with the living ?

the 0 female employees talked to each other and made no effort to greet or even look at me eventually i was asked my order i ordered two cheeseburgers with mac sauce they add 0 cents per sandwich for the sauce and a small drink i waited and waited and the cup for my drink was never offered no big deal honestly but i figured one of the 0 people sanding around talking and doing nothing else could

my friends and i have been regulars to the 0 rd and 0 th cart as we call it since we were kids my partner and his friends call it greasy meat on the street i have fond memories of ending late night drinking clubbing as a young wide eyed club goer with a metallic platter from the halal guys <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">after</span> waiting on a seemingly never ending line at 0 am the 0 hours <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">diarrhea</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">delay</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">always</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">seemed</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">worth</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">it</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">you</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">have</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">n&#39;t</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">really</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">experienced</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">nyc</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">until</span> you &#39;ve had some <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">stomach</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">upset</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">street</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">it</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">used</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">be</span> $ 0 but now with the rise in popularity prices have increased to $ 0 i ca n&#39;t decide if the quality has deteriorated as well if it &#39;s just a fact of growing up or if after 0 years in the middle east eating actual arab <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> but 0 rd and 0 th has lost its luster the service to be fair is much quicker with a faster turnaround i&#39;m also very excited that they &#39;ve now opened an actual brick and mortar location but the flavour and taste is not the same the meat has less spices to it the portions are smaller and the sauce is more mayonnaisey than it used to be as a place to get a quick bite after the moma or after clubbing you &#39;re good to go just make sure you have a bathroom nearby

before i give my rant about why i &#39;ll never go back again let me start off by saying i love bar nine ! we came here two years ago for new years eve and had an amazing time we came back tonight for a friend &#39;s birthday and i was absolutely mortified by what happened the bathrooms are downstairs from where you sit to listen to the amazing dueling pianos i was standing at the top of the stairs as a bouncer warned me to be careful because someone had puked on the stairs i held onto the railing as i walked down but lost my balance on a pile of puke about halfway down and fell down a few steps i shook it off and went to the bathroom here &#39;s what got <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">me</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> walked <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">back</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">upstairs</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">after</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">there</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> a handful of men waiting at the top of the steps i assume the manager owner or someone else afraid of being sued who said i heard you puked and fell in it i responded by saying that i did not get sick and that i actually slipped in someone else &#39;s throw <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">up</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">they</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">gave</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">me</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">such</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hard</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">time</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">saying</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">that</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">whole</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">thing</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">my</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">fault</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">we</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">left</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">immediately</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">my</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">friends</span> and i will absolutely not be going back there i would have been completely fine if someone was waiting at the top of the stairs to ask if i was okay or if nobody said anything at all but the fact that they tried to cover themselves by putting the blame on me is the reasons for this review i suggest staying far away there are other places to see dueling pianos in manhattan

very mixed feelings went for a birthday dinner with two other people place is beautiful inside and the staff is very friendly but as we were being seated i was already noticing a very sweet cloying floral scent throughout the restaurant we were seated two minutes in one of my companions commented on the strong scent we discussed whether it was some cleaner or disinfectant or an overenthusiastic use of air freshener we looked around for floral incense by the time the water was brought all three of us were already overwhelmed by this scent what one wants to smell in a restaurant is the food and not to get scientific on yelp but the sense of smell is closely related to the sense of taste i do n&#39;t want to be eating lasuni gobi and tasting some unidentifiable sweet chemical taste in addition i am prone to migraines triggered by colognes perfumes stale air etc and i was already regretting the choice of restaurant my companion then apologetically asked if we could sit outside as she did n&#39;t want to get sick <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">overwhelmingly</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">cloying</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">air</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">there</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">were</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">only</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">three</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">outside</span> tables but we managed to get one food was excellent we shared several appetizers and entrees and all loved the meal service was slow and the restaurant was not busy i would put the long waits down to the fact that the <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> is prepared fresh and that takes longer but even getting the check and having the <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">person</span> pick <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">up</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">credit</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">card</span> for payment took a long time during a trip to the rest room i guessed that the overwhelming scent might be from heavily scented candles throughout the <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">restaurant</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">would</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">love</span> to return for the <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">but</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">this</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">would</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">only</span> be <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">possible</span> if <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">could</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">again</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">secure</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">one</span> of the three outside tables what a shame

the friend i was travelling with had been here a number of times and raved about the incredible food and impeccable service i booked a reservation at the restaurant for 0 pm on march 0 th we arrived at exactly 0 and learne our table was not yet ready no one offered to seat us at the bar or high tops we waited awkwardly at front with our coats after waiting 0 minutes the hostess took our coats and we requested to be seated at the bar for a drink and a chance to look at the menu we were given menus and promptly served water but then the bartender disappeared a couple who did not have a reservation and who arrived at the restaurant after we had been seated at the bar were promptly accommodated at the high tops in the bar area they were already drinking wine and eating tapas before the bartender even offered us a drink we told the bartender we would eat at the bar as it was getting late and we both had important meetings the following day our table was ready before we ordered our <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> so we were moved to the table and the bartender advised us that our drinks were complimentary due to the 0 minute delay getting our table we finally placed our order after being in the restaurant for 0 minutes while my friend was eating the paella one of the meats had a very odd flavour she finished the mouthful she had but did not eat anymore the following day she was violently <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">ill</span> to the <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">point</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">that</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hotel</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">housekeeper</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">wanted</span> to call a doctor i myself did not feel well a few <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hours</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">after</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">our</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">meal</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">but</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">not</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">as</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">as</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">my</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">friend</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">service</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">awful</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">hostess</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">to</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">servers</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">somewhat</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">tasty</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">but</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">far</span> too rich and heavy when we attempted to decline dessert the server insisted on bringing us a menu but then disappeared not to return ten minutes later we flagged a separate server to insist on our bill if i had n&#39;t been told this restaurant had a michelin star i would n&#39;t have believed it from my experience

at my review record i have over 0 reviews now my 0 star reviews outnumber the 0 and 0 star reviews combined i do n&#39;t want to drop one star unless it &#39;s warranted you have to absolutely suck to get the one star treatment in my book bonnie &#39;s grill is a snug fit for that category i have been here several times before the wings were decent to good and the burgers were ok service was never ironed out and was just barely acceptable overall never anything worth writing home about but like any sinking ship they have fallen off and completely died a death in regards to service and food considering this was a saturday night and we &#39;re the only party <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">actually</span> waiting for a table there are no excuses only poor management delegation to unqualified people and most importantly not giving a crap this time around we were blessed with seeing what the worst waiter on earth looks and acts like a disgruntled rude and downright unpleasant dude in a black cap who 0 forgot our orders twice and did n&#39;t seem to care about a damn thing pertaining to what &#39;s going on in the restaurant 0 did n&#39;t care to explain what &#39;s going on and why the food is taking an hour to come out 0 called my wife cranky when we asked what &#39;s taking so long among other classic hostile behaviors but that &#39;s what happens when you pick out some someone from at best the waiting room at a court ordered anger management group and make him the face of your operation brilliant i was a server for a few years and the baseline communication that i foster for any person especially someone in the service industry is respect this was a thoroughly disrespectful nasty character who with his sociopathic communication style showed that he deserved none in return what &#39;s someone like this doing working with people ? after we ask what &#39;s taking so long the sorry looking wings come out to our table it took exactly an hour some people in our party refused to touch the <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">food</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">based</span> on the terrible look of them i <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">ate</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">few</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg

class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">edible</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">but</span> not good by the time the cold main dishes came out accompanied by a rancid smell we had decided to leave and pay what we owed up to that point based on how poorly this place is run it &#39;s no wonder that they are neglecting proper food storage as well evidenced by raw chicken sitting out for an hour prior to frying and risking your health with pathetic oversights it &#39;s just one bullet point on the long list of lapses occuring here you know something is wrong when a 0 seat spot that serves wings and burgers ca n&#39;t get serving wings and burgers down my closing statement you can gamble with your time and health and come here maybe you &#39;ll have a decent or even a good time it &#39;s happened before just look at some of the other reviews or you can do the considerate thing for yourself and whoever you plan on sharing a meal with and avoid risking an awful experience or even worse days in bed losing all kinds of fluids <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">from</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">wherever</span> they will forcibly make their

i would have never thought to do a juice cleanse but my coworker somehow suckered me in to do one with him we did n&#39;t really know anything about them but figured it would be fine we heard they had deals on groupon so decided to check it out we went with the best deal and also the best reviews that was our first mistake there were 0 drinks to have for each of the 0 day cleanse two were all greens and they were the grossest tasting liquid i &#39;ve ever had not only did they smell disgusting the taste was just unbearable my coworker literally had to hold his nose to get it down after the first one my stomach was so unsettled i thought i might vomit i did n&#39;t give up and we continued on to the next drink after the second one again stomach ached and felt <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">nauseous</span> they say starting a cleanse may make you feel <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">but</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">would</span> n&#39;t wish this on anyone my coworker thought i should go home <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> looked so <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">ill</span> but <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> still did n&#39;t give up after <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">each</span> drink i <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">felt</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">sick</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">and</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">almost</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">threw</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">in</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">towel</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">the</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">first</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">day</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">but</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">said</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">would</span> give it a chance that was my second mistake the next <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">day</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">no</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">better</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">i</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">was</span> n&#39;t hungry but <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">felt</span> so weak i thought i would collapse my coworker did n&#39;t feel ill but he <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">got</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">a</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">headache</span> we <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">both</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">also</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">noted</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">that</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">we</span> were <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">having</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">some</span> <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">trouble</span> concentrating this probably should have signaled <span class="ansi-red-intense-fg ansi-bold">us</span> to stop but we again said we &#39;d keep going mistake three on the final day i was not hungry at all but my coworker was we endured and looked forward to being able to eat real food again these were the most awful tasting drinks i have ever had i was not expecting them to taste like a smoothie which tastes like a milkshake but i would expect it to be somewhat bearable i admit not all 0 tasted horribly but 0 did and that &#39;s more than half which is too much for me i eat healthy already salads raw vegetables not much processed food so figured it would not be so different it was i was actually very surprised at how bad they tasted it was like they did n&#39;t use fresh vegetables or something all in all this may not be my last juice cleanse but it will definitely be the last one i will ever get from this company
